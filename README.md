# Knowledge

Configuration variables are a project's knowledge. This gem is here to help your projects learn what they need to work properly.

Knowledge is a multi-source highly customizable configuration variables manager.


## Disclaimer

The library has been entirely rewritten and I'm currently writing the documentation for the new version. If you don't want to wait for the documentation to use the new version, please refer to the few examples below and to the code directly.

You can find the documentation for `0.x` versions in the [wiki](https://github.com/knowledge-ruby/knowledge/wiki)

## Knowledge official ecosystem

- [knowledge](https://github.com/knowledge-ruby/knowledge) - Core project

- [knowledge-ssm](https://github.com/knowledge-ruby/knowledge-ssm) - SSM Adapter

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'knowledge', '~> 1.0'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knowledge -v "~> 1.0"

## Usage

**Using default stuff**:

```ruby
Knowledge.learn_from :hash, variables: { key: :value }

Knowledge::Configuration.key # => "value"
```

**Using a config file**:

```yml
key: value
```

```ruby
Knowledge.learn_from :yaml, variables: 'path/to/file.yml'

Knowledge::Configuration.key # => "value"
```

Or

```yml
development:
    key: value
production:
    key: other_value
```

```ruby
Knowledge.environment = :production

Knowledge.learn_from :yaml, variables: 'path/to/file.yml'

Knowledge::Configuration.key # => "other_value"
```

**Using your own getter**:

```ruby
module Knowledge
  module Getters
    class MyCustomUrlGetter
      def initialize(url)
        @url = url
      end

      def call
        @data = JSON.parse(HTTParty.get(url).body)
      end
    end
  end
end

url = 'https://api.mycompany.com/config/project-5.json'

Knowledge.learn_from :my_custom_url_getter, variables: url

Rails.application.config.key # => "value"
```

**Using your own setter**:

```ruby
module Knowledge
  module Setters
    class MyCustomRailsSetter < Base
      def call
        @data.each do |key, value|
          set(name: key, value: value)
        end
      end

      def set(name:, value:)
        Rails.application.config.public_send("#{name}=", value)
      end
    end
  end
end

Knowledge.learn_from :hash,
                     variables: { key: :value },
                     setter: :my_custom_rails_setter

Rails.application.config.key # => "value"
```

## Development

### Without docker

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### With docker

First, please ensure you've got docker and docker-compose properly setup on your computer

Then run:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

Once the build has been done, run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You will be able to see linting and test tasks running each time you change a file.

You will also find the yard doc under `http://localhost:5001` and the coverage under `http://localhost:5002`.

You can have a look at the `Makefile` if you want to use some extra utilities.
