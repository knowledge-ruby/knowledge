Knowledge::Configuration.key # => "value"
```

Or

```yml
development:
    key: value
production:
    key: other_value
```

```ruby
Knowledge.config.environment = :production

knowledge = Knowledge::Learner.new

knowledge.use(name: :file)
knowledge.variables = 'path/to/file.yml'
knowledge.gather!

Knowledge::Configuration.key # => "other_value"
```

    #
    def set(name:, value:)
        Rails.application.config.public_send("#{name}=", value)
    end
end

knowledge = Knowledge::Learner.new

knowledge.setter = MyCustomRailsSetter.new
knowledge.use(name: :default)
knowledge.variables = { key: :value }
knowledge.gather!

Rails.application.config.key # => "value"
```

## Development

### Without docker

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### With docker

First, please ensure you've got docker and docker-compose properly setup on your computer

Then run:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

Once the build has been done, run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You will be able to see linting and test tasks running each time you change a file.

You will also find the yard doc under `http://localhost:5001` and the coverage under `http://localhost:5002`.

You can have a look at the `Makefile` if you want to use some extra utilities.
